## MentorMe

MentorMe is a we app where you can put yourself out there as a mentor and people who are looking for mentors can find you and request you. If someone has requested to be your mentee, you can then decide if you want to accept that mentorship. Once the mentorship has been accepted, you can start chatting with each other and make goals, or decide when to meet up.
